The main goal of the app is to create and publish adverts that can be viewed by other users limiting fake and incorrect adverts.

Every picture of vehicle must be captured via the app, together with the picture we also capture the latitude and longitude and store them in AES encrypted SQLite database on the phone, leaving no possibility to publish advert with incorrect location and/or fake pictures.

Most of logic is leaved to the WebAPI backend.

The is simply proof of concept and can be further developed.
